#### Explanation:
If we have a sorted array, we just need to loop the array and put the value in the array to two new array seperately. The time compleixity of the loop function is O(n). Since the needed time complexity is O(nlog(n)), we need to use merge sort rather than bubble sort to sort the array. The space complexity is O(n).
