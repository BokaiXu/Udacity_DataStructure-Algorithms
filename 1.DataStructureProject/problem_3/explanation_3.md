For this question, I follow the logic of hoffman coding visualization (https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/ylucet/DS/Huffman.html).
Firstly, I write the priority queue class to store the tree nodes. Then I write the tree class for building the Huffman coding tree.
I write several helper functions to finish the encoding and decoding.
count_freq() is used to convert the string to a dictionary that stores each character and the frequency. Time and space Complexity is O(n).
Tree_generator() is used to generate the Huffman coding tree using the logic in the link (https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/ylucet/DS/Huffman.html). In this function, while traverse the priority queue, every time I have to insert the value of the (left-node+right-node) as a new node back to the priority queue. Since I have to compare the value of the new node with the nodes in the queue,the time complexity should be O(n*n). The space complexity should be O(n).
The encoder() function is used to recursively go through the Huffman coding tree and build the dictionary that stores the character in the string and the realted 0-1 information. The time and space complexity for this recursion is O(n).
The huffman_encoding() function call the helper functions.
The huffman_decoding() function traverse the encoded data and traverse the Huffman tree for each character in the encoded data. Hence the time compleixty should be O(n*n). The space complexity should be O(len(encoded_data)+len(decoded_data)+len(Huffman_tree)).
