To get O(1) in get() function and put/set() function of the LRU_Cache, we need to use hash map/python dictionary.
Since the oldest element needed to be deleted firstly, it reminds me a queue.    
I will use a double linked list to save the values. A head pointer is used to delete the head.next (oldest element). The tail pointer is used to insert the tail.prev (latest element).    
The only problem for using double linked list is how can I find the node of element I need in O(1) for the get methond. To solve this issue, I will use hash map to save the key, and save the related value as a Node(eg: dict[key]=Node(value)).    
Using hash map, I can find the node I need in O(1). When I delete the oldest node, I also need to delete the related key from the hashmap. To get the key from related node, I also need to store the key in the node(eg: dict[key]=Node(key,value)).
